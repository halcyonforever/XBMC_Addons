Custom playlists are the recommended method for creating channel's from Kodi library content.
PseudoTV Live supports playlist types: Movies, Episodes and Music. Do not use "TV Shows".
Kodi does not allow in-interface creation of a mixed movies/TV playlists but one can be created manually and will be usable by PseudoTV Live: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<smartplaylist type="mixed">
<name>Generic TV and Movie Playlist</name>
<match>one</match>
<rule field="playlist" operator="is">tv show episode playlist filename.xsp</rule>
<rule field="playlist" operator="is">movie playlist filename.xsp</rule>
<order direction="ascending">random</order>
</smartplaylist>

Preconfigured smartplaylists are available using the "Browse Community playlists" button.
